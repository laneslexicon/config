This is a "clean" configuration setup for the laneslexicon application.

It should be extracted to the Resources directory.

In *nix and Windows this is a subdirectory of the directory in which the executable is found.

In OSX the is the Resources directory of the application bundle.

One way do this is to move into the Resources directory and do

git clone https://github.com/laneslexicon/config.git .

(Note the dot at the end of the line.)
